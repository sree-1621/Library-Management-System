Nested router

for one webpage you can have only one Browser router
giving routes inside another component and importing that component to app.js


Route parameters
the value of that keep on changing in a website will be given as route parameter
Route path="/book-list/:id"   => here ' id ' is the route parameter


useParams can be only used just to fech the changing value in the url. cannot use for the non changing url 
ie., it can be only used to fetch single value

useLocation : used to access the link address
